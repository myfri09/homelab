# üè† Homelab

## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration and documentation of my homelab.

The goals are learning and enjoyment. As a DevOps engineer I work with Kubernetes daily, and this homelab is where I explore new ideas. Self-hosting selected applications keeps me accountable for the entire lifecycle from deployment to operations, which encourages clear thinking around backups, security, scalability and maintainability.

## At a glance

- Kubernetes with GitOps driven operations
- Cloudflare Tunnels for secure remote access
- TrueNAS backed storage with NFS CSI for dynamic provisioning
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and dashboards

## Prerequisites

- K3s cluster
- kubectl configured
- Git repository access

#### Initial Setup

##### 1. Install ArgoCD

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

##### 2.Get ArgoCD Password
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

##### 3. Deploy Root Application
kubectl apply -f clusters/staging/argocd/root-app.yaml

### Platform and operations

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [ArgoCD](https://fluxcd.io/) | GitOps engine that fits my workflows |
| [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) | eBPF networking, observability and security |
| [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) | Observability dashboards |
| [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) | Metrics and alerting backend |
| [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) | Private tunnels for selected services |
| [NFS CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs) | Dynamic NFS provisioning backed by TrueNAS exports |

## Networking

Kubernetes runs Cilium as the CNI. Service addresses are allocated with Cilium LoadBalancer IPAM. The ingress layer uses the Cilium Gateway API, which avoids operating a separate ingress controller. At the edge I use a UniFi Cloud Gateway Fiber with VLANs and strict traffic rules.

## Storage

Primary NAS is a TrueNAS system.

* Kubernetes dynamic provisioning uses the NFS CSI driver backed by TrueNAS exports.
* A separate NFS share serves data that must be shared across clusters.

## Operations

### GitOps and environments

* Flux manages all clusters from this repository.
* Changes land through pull requests, then ArgoCD reconciles them.
